# PRAC_1: 4-Bit Prime Number Decoder

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to design a combinational logic circuit using Verilog that:
1.  Reads a 4-bit binary input from the FPGA switches.
2.  Determines if the input number is **Prime** (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13).
3.  Indicates the result by turning on an **LED**.

## Included Files
* `Prim4.V`: Main Verilog source code for the prime number logic.
* `Prim4_tb.v`: Testbench file used for simulation.
* `Prim4_tb.vcd`: Waveform output from the simulation.
* `a.out`: Compiled executable (generated by Icarus Verilog).

## Hardware & Software
* **Board:** Terasic DE10-Lite (Intel MAX 10 FPGA)
* **Synthesis:** Intel Quartus Prime Lite
* **Simulation:** Icarus Verilog (OSS CAD Suite) / Questa

## Logic Table
The system checks the decimal equivalent of the switches:
* **0, 1:** Not Prime ❌ (LED OFF)
* **2, 3, 5, 7:** Prime ✅ (LED ON)
* **4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15:** Not Prime ❌ (LED OFF)
* **11, 13:** Prime ✅ (LED ON)
